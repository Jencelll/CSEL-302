## Getting Started

An Introduction to Intelligent Systems covers the fundamental concepts and principles underlying the design, development, and application of systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. Here's an overview:

Definition of Intelligent Systems:
Intelligent systems are computer-based systems that exhibit characteristics commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. These systems are designed to emulate human-like behavior or to perform tasks that require some form of intelligence.

Overall, an Introduction to Intelligent Systems provides a foundational understanding of the principles, techniques, applications, and challenges associated with designing and deploying systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. It encompasses a broad and interdisciplinary field that continues to evolve with advances in technology and research.

### Lecture 1

An Introduction to Intelligent Agents

What is AI?
- AI refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence possessed by humans and animals.
It encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that enable machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously.

Types of Intelligent Agents
- Some common types include:
Simple reflex agents: React directly to their environment based on predetermined rules.
Model-based reflex agents: Build internal models of the world to make decisions.
Goal-based agents: Have goals they aim to achieve and plan actions accordingly.
Utility-based agents: Select actions based on their expected utility or value.
Learning agents: Can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time.
Social agents: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social setting

Characteristics of Intelligent Agents:
- Reactivity: Perceive their environment and respond to changes.
- Proactiveness: Take initiative and adapt their behavior to achieve goals.
- Socialability: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social context.
- Adaptability: Learn and adjust their behavior based on new information and experiences.
- Rationality: Make decisions that maximize their chances of success![image](https://github.com/Jencelll/CSEL-302/assets/168052418/31d2459b-bdb3-4fc3-b6b0-71b67d39d9ad)
