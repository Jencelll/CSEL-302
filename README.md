<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>An Introduction to Intelligent Systems covers the fundamental concepts and principles underlying the design, development, and application of systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. Here's an overview:</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Intelligent Systems:</strong> Intelligent systems are computer-based systems that exhibit characteristics commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. These systems are designed to emulate human-like behavior or to perform tasks that require some form of intelligence.</p>
<p>Overall, an Introduction to Intelligent Systems provides a foundational understanding of the principles, techniques, applications, and challenges associated with designing and deploying systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. It encompasses a broad and interdisciplinary field that continues to evolve with advances in technology and research.</p>

<p>An Introduction to Intelligent Agents</p>
<p>What is AI?

AI refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence possessed by humans and animals. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that enable machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously.
Types of Intelligent Agents

Some common types include: Simple reflex agents: React directly to their environment based on predetermined rules. Model-based reflex agents: Build internal models of the world to make decisions. Goal-based agents: Have goals they aim to achieve and plan actions accordingly. Utility-based agents: Select actions based on their expected utility or value. Learning agents: Can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. Social agents: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social setting
Characteristics of Intelligent Agents:

Reactivity: Perceive their environment and respond to changes.
Proactiveness: Take initiative and adapt their behavior to achieve goals.
Socialability: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social context.
Adaptability: Learn and adjust their behavior based on new information and experiences.
Rationality: Make decisions that maximize their chances of success</p>

<p>Data Analysis and Visualization</p>
<p>Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data collection is the process of gathering information. Just like collecting different types of toys or stamps, data collection involves bringing together pieces of information from various sources. This information could be anything from survey responses and observations to measurements and interviews.
Data preprocessing is the process of getting your data ready for analysis or machine learning by cleaning, organizing, and formatting it. It involves tasks like removing errors, dealing with missing information, and making sure the data is in a usable form. Think of it as preparing ingredients before cooking â€“ you want them clean and well-prepared for the best results. In data analysis, having clean and well-organized data ensures accurate and meaningful insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

a critical process in data analysis, and it serves as the initial step before diving into more in-depth analysis or modeling.
Data Preprocessing Techniques

Understand Data: EDA helps you get a clear picture of the data you're working with. It involves examining the data's structure, contents, and basic characteristics. This step includes looking at the types of variables (numeric, categorical), the distribution of data, and identifying any missing values or outliers.
Identify Patterns: EDA allows you to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. By creating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, you can spot patterns that may not be apparent through simple statistics or summary tables.
Detect Anomalies: An important role of EDA is to identify anomalies or outliers in the data. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the majority and can skew analysis. Understanding their presence and potential impact is crucial.
Formulate Hypotheses: EDA often leads to the formulation of hypotheses or educated guesses about the data. By exploring relationships and patterns, you can generate hypotheses that guide further analysis and experimentation.
Guide Decision-Making: EDA informs decisions about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling strategies. It helps you decide which variables are relevant, whether data transformation is needed, and which statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms are suitable.
Communicate Insights: EDA aids in communicating findings and insights to stakeholders or team members. Visualizations generated during EDA make it easier to convey complex information in a more understandable way.</p>

<p>Probability & Statistics</p>
<p>Probability implies 'likelihood' or 'chance'. When an event is certain to happen then the probability of occurrence of that event is 1 and when it is certain that the event cannot happen then the probability of that event is 0.

Random Variables

A random variable is a mathematical concept used to represent uncertain outcomes in probability and statistics.
It's a variable that can take on different values with a certain probability associated with each value.
Coin Toss: One of the most common examples of a random variable is the outcome of a fair coin toss.

Random Variable: X
Possible Values: {Heads (H), Tails (T)}
Probability Distribution: P(X = H) = 0.5, P(X = T) = 0.5
Probability Distributions

A probability distribution describes the likelihood of each possible outcome for a random variable.
It tells us how probable each value is and provides a complete picture of the random variable's behavior.
Types of Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution:

Applicable when there are only two possible outcomes (e.g., success or failure).
Often used in scenarios like coin flips, where the probability of success (p) and failure (q) is known. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):
Commonly observed in natural phenomena and real-world data.
Has a bell-shaped curve with a mean (average) and standard deviation</p>

<h3 id="lecture-4">Lecture 4</h3>
<p>Linear Regression</p>
<p> a statistical method used in the field of data analysis and predictive modeling. It's particularly useful in understanding and modeling relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors).
Dependent Variable:

The dependent variable, also known as the "response variable" or "outcome variable," is the variable that you are trying to understand, predict, or explain in a statistical analysis or experiment.
It's the variable that you measure or observe. Its value depends on the values of other variables in the study.
Independent Variable:

The independent variable, also known as the "explanatory variable" or "predictor variable," is the variable that you manipulate or examine to see how it affects the dependent variable.
Types of Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression: It involves one independent variable, and the equation takes the form y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the intercept.

Multiple Linear Regression: It involves multiple independent variables, and the equation becomes y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn, where 'b0' is the intercept, and 'b1, b2, ... bn' are the coefficients for the respective independent variables.</p>

<h3 id="lecture-5">Lecture 5</h3>
<p>Logistic Regression</p>
<p>Logistic Regression is a statistical technique used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables. It models the probability of a binary event occurring, such as success/failure, yes/no, or pass/fail scenarios."

"Developing a Logistic Regression model involves several key steps: First, selecting relevant features. Second, using a training dataset to fit the model. Finally, interpreting the model coefficients to understand the influence of each predictor."</p>
