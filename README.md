## Getting Started

An Introduction to Intelligent Systems covers the fundamental concepts and principles underlying the design, development, and application of systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. Here's an overview:

Definition of Intelligent Systems:
Intelligent systems are computer-based systems that exhibit characteristics commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. These systems are designed to emulate human-like behavior or to perform tasks that require some form of intelligence.

Overall, an Introduction to Intelligent Systems provides a foundational understanding of the principles, techniques, applications, and challenges associated with designing and deploying systems that exhibit intelligent behavior. It encompasses a broad and interdisciplinary field that continues to evolve with advances in technology and research.
